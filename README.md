# Team BNM
# Driver Dronwsiness Detection Project
# Objective
Our project utilizes artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, to develop an automated system for detecting 
driver drowsiness in real time. This innovation aligns with our broader objective of enhancing road safety and reducing 
accident risks through advanced AI-driven monitoring solutions. By accurately identifying signs of fatigue, the system will 
help prevent drowsiness-related incidents, ultimately improving driver well-being, reducing accident rates, and 
supporting industry efforts to promote safer transportation practices.
